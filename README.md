# factor_analysis_key_latent_variables_italian_cities
This repository contains the analysis and findings from a study aiming to identify the key latent variables that describe 92 Italian cities, using data sourced from Eurostat. The project leverages Factor Analysis, a statistical technique for identifying underlying patterns in multivariate data, to uncover the dimensions that shape urban characteristics.

ðŸ“‘ Project Overview

	â€¢	Research Question: What are the key latent variables able to describe Italian cities?
	â€¢	Dataset: Data on 96 Italian cities and 23 variables describing various factors such as population, housing, tourism, and employment.
	â€¢	Approach:
	â€¢	Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and standardization.
	â€¢	Factor analysis using different rotations (none, Varimax, Promax, Oblimin).
	â€¢	Interpretation of latent variables based on their contributions to explaining city characteristics.

ðŸš€ Features

	1.	Data Preprocessing:
	â€¢	Converted dataset variables to numeric.
	â€¢	Addressed missing values using linear interpolation.
	â€¢	Reduced dimensionality by removing highly correlated variables.
	2.	Factor Analysis:
	â€¢	Extracted four primary factors:
	1.	Socio-Economic Status and Tourism Activity.
	2.	Housing Characteristics.
	3.	Population and Employment.
	4.	Unemployment.
	â€¢	Explored factor correlations to interpret relationships among urban dimensions.
	3.	Rotations:
	â€¢	Evaluated models with no rotation, Varimax, Promax, and Oblimin.
	â€¢	Selected Oblimin rotation for final interpretation due to its ability to represent correlated factors.
	4.	Insights:
	â€¢	Socio-economic status and tourism activity are positively correlated with population and employment.
	â€¢	High socio-economic status often correlates with smaller average house sizes in urban centers.

ðŸ“Š Tools and Libraries Used
